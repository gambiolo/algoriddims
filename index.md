## It is a weird thing to study tech and music at the same time, but keeping it weird is not forbiden, and sometimes you need to make shit happens because it's worth it...association is key

ITS WORTH IT to book Moodymann in Texas because he was forbiden in that specific states (I took that personally) 

ITS WORTH IT organising an after party with Osunlade at a festival up in the french alps

ITS WORTH IT to book Mala to play in Paris for the first time

ITS WORTH IT getting GOTAN PROJECT inna 17's century building in the prostitute quarter
